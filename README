	      instructions for local hooks
-----------------------------------------------------------

Hooks are scripts that run before or after certain events
in Git. The "commit-msg" hook for example runs after the
commit message is edited and checks for the correct format.

For security reasons, local hooks have to be activated
manually for every single repository.
There are several ways of doing that:

1: Copy the contained scripts into the directory
	.git/hooks/
   in your local repository.

2: Create links from 
	.git/hooks/
   to the scripts you like to use.

3: Copy this folder to your local repository and run
	installhooks
   to create links to all available hooks.
